# MassZipExtractor
A small python program that extracts multiple .zip files to a given directory.

To execute, run `python extract_all_zip_files_to_directory.py` or `python3 extract_all_zip_files_to_directory.py`. You will be prompted to input a **source directory**,
which is the directory from which all the .zip files will be taken. You can press `Enter` to use the current directory. You will also be prompted to input a **target directory** 
which will be where the .zip files will be extracted to. Again, you can input `Enter` to use the current directory. You will finally be prompted to input y/n depending
on if you want the .zip files to be deleted after extraction.
